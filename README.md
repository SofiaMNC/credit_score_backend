# Credit Scoring Web App - Backend

## Overview
This is the backend of the credit scoring web app. 
It provides a REST API by which to access relevant data for each anonymized client.
It uses a machine learning model created using the Home Credit Default Risk dataset provided by the Home Credit Group.

The backend uses WSGI and Flask, and accesses static data stored on an Amazon S3 bucket.
The server stubs were generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project, using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki).
